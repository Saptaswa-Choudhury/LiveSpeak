LiveSpeak will be an AI-Based Live Event Captioning software that will use Speech Recognition to generate captions for any sort of Live Events, both online and offline. The software will take live audio feed as input and then break it down into smaller audio chunks. These audio chunks will then go through the deep-learning speech-to-text AI model which will process the audio chunks in parallel to achieve near real-time output. There will be a post-processing layer that will apply several enhancements such as punctuation and capitalization. The final captions will then be delivered, allowing seamless integration with web browsers and third party streaming platforms. In order to maintain a smooth and synchronized viewing experience with minimum latency, the user client will be a lightweight application which will only render the incoming text. 

LiveSpeak is a real-time transcription platform that is designed specifically for live events. Most other captioning solutions suffer from high latency and inability to properly process some technical jargon whcih causes a disjointed viewer experience. Meanwhile, LiveSpeak shines through by using deep learning models for speech recognition and delivers highly accurate captions with minimal delay. This software easily handles both online and in-person live events. Our core technology listens to the speaker, converts their words to text using an advanced AI, and then instantly refines the output. This final step corrects errors and formats the text, making sure that specialized jargon and unique event terminology always come out looking perfect.

The user will also have the choice to use our real-time correction dashboard. This lets someone from your team keep an eye on the captions as they're generated and make edits on the fly.
